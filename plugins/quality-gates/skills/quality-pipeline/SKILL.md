# Quality Gates — In-Turn Orchestrator (v2.2.0)

You are running the **full quality-gates pipeline** in a single assistant
turn. You dispatch the two gates serially in order. At decision points
(review-iter boundary, runtime needs-resolve) you call
`AskUserQuestion` and branch on the user's response — the response arrives
as a tool result in the same turn, so no Stop hook and no continuation
sentinel are needed.

**Law 2 (Writer ≠ Reviewer):** you are the orchestrator (writer). `security-reviewer`, `adversarial`, and `test-scope-validator` are read-only reviewers (`disallowedTools: [Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit]`). The `runtime-verifier` is a **sandbox executor**: it CAN Write/Edit, but only inside a disposable git-worktree sandbox, and you enforce Law 2 *structurally* — after it runs you compute `qg-worktree.sh mutation-guard <sandbox> <baseline>` and, if `forced_downgrade: yes`, you cap the verdict at FAIL regardless of what the verifier claimed. Nothing is committed; the sandbox is discarded. You may also apply user-approved Review-gate fixes ("Retry" path) via Edit/Write — those are user-consented.

**State file:** read `worktree_path` from `.claude/quality-gates/<sid>/pipeline.md`
only during preflight; never write. Setup script handles creation, /cancel-qg
handles deletion.

## Contents

이 SKILL은 단일 어시스턴트 턴 안에서 전체 파이프라인을 실행. 섹션 그룹:

1. **Workflow (top-to-bottom on invocation):**
   - [Preflight](#preflight) — kill switch / setup-qg / pre-pipeline-check
   - [Arguments](#arguments) — `/qg` flags 파싱
   - [Dispatch Loop](#dispatch-loop) — two gates serialized in order with per-gate iteration
2. **Per-gate dispatch logic:**
   - [Trivia escape](#trivia-escape) — one-sentence diff → all gates skipped
   - [Review gate](#review-gate) — scout + Phase 1 + adversarial + synthesizer; iter loop with decision tool at every boundary
   - [Runtime gate](#runtime-gate) — test-scope-validator + runtime-verifier
3. **Decision points (AskUserQuestion templates):**
   - [Review iter boundary decision](#review-iter-boundary-decision)
   - [Review max-iter decision](#review-max-iter-decision)
   - [Runtime NEEDS_RESOLUTION decision](#runtime-needs_resolution-decision)
4. **Output templates** (verbatim, field substitution):
   - Review / Runtime result templates
   - Final summary template
   - [Rules](#rules) — Law 2 invariants, state file invariants

## Preflight

이 섹션은 첫 번째 (그리고 유일한) SKILL 호출에서 한 번만 실행된다.

**Step P0 — Derive project_dir (dispatch coordinate).** Compute the project
directory ONCE at preflight; freeze the value for the rest of the turn:

```bash
project_dir=$(pwd)
```

This value is threaded into every reviewer dispatch via the `project_dir:`
field (see [Reviewer dispatch contract](#reviewer-dispatch-contract)).
Worktree-aware: `pwd` resolves to the active worktree root. Do NOT re-derive
in any per-dispatch block — the reviewer agents declare `project_dir` as a
required dispatch parameter and forbid `pwd`/`git rev-parse` recomputation
in their personas.

**Step P1 — Global kill switch.** If `DEVBREW_DISABLE_QUALITY_GATES=1`,
emit `[quality-gates] disabled via DEVBREW_DISABLE_QUALITY_GATES=1` and
return immediately. Do NOT call setup-qg.sh or any agent.

**Step P2 — Setup state.** Run:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-qg.sh" --ensure $ARGUMENTS
```

`setup-qg.sh --ensure` creates the per-session state file
(`.claude/quality-gates/<sid>/pipeline.md`) with minimal v1.32.0 schema.
Exit non-zero → surface stderr verbatim and abort.

**Step P3 — Pre-pipeline check (scope detection).** Run:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pre-pipeline-check.sh"
```

The script exits non-zero on hard precondition violations (`no_session_id`,
`invalid_session_id`) and zero on normal codes. **Non-zero exit must abort
the pipeline immediately** — surface the script's stderr verbatim and stop.
Do NOT proceed to the Review gate with degraded state.

On zero exit, parse the `result:` line. Handle every emitted code; unknown
values are a contract violation, not "treat as fresh":

| `result:` | Meaning | Downstream action |
|---|---|---|
| `fresh_start` | First run on this branch | normal — silent |
| `preserved` | Session file fresh; reuse | normal — silent |
| `no_session_data` | No prior state | normal — silent |
| `cleared_branch_mismatch` | HEAD branch changed; state wiped | tell user "branch changed; session scope reset"; do not use prior files.md |
| `cleared_stale` | Session file aged out; deleted | tell user "stale session data cleared"; do not use prior files.md |
| `active_resume` | Mid-pipeline resume on same session | continue with existing state |
| (other) | Unknown — contract violation | abort with stderr verbatim |

## Arguments

Parse from `/qg` invocation:
- `gate` (optional): `review`, `runtime`, or absent (full pipeline).
- `plan_path` (optional): defaults to "auto" (`scripts/discover-plan.sh`).
  Threaded as a secondary scope hint to the Runtime gate's test-scope-validator
  and the Review gate's security-reviewer / adversarial dispatches. The Gate-1
  plan-verifier was removed in v2.0.0 — plan is no longer verified, only hinted.
- `spec_path` (optional): defaults to "auto" (`scripts/discover-spec.sh`).
  The project spec is the Acceptance Criteria truth. Consumed by the Runtime
  gate's test-scope-validator (used to assess per-AC coverage — emitted as the advisory `ac_coverage` output) and by
  the Review gate codex path (spec AC injected into `<spec_context>`,
  script-internal in `run_codex_reviewer.sh`). If
  `DEVBREW_QG_DISABLE_SPEC_CONFORMANCE=1`, pass `spec_path: none` to the
  test-scope-validator dispatch — this forces the no-spec fallback (ac_coverage
  omitted, plan-based scope only). All spec behavior is advisory; it never
  blocks a gate.
- `pr_url` (optional).
- `skip_runtime` (flag): if set, skip the Runtime gate.
- `paths` (optional, repeatable): scope override for the Review gate diff.

Single-gate mode (`review`/`runtime`) runs ONLY the named gate and
emits its verdict directly — no decision-tool call, no inter-gate
transition.

## Upfront Execution Plan

Decide runtime scope ONCE, before any gate runs, but only when there is something risky to decide. After [Preflight](#preflight) and [Arguments](#arguments), and before the [Dispatch Loop](#dispatch-loop):

1. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-runtime.sh` to get the manifest with `requires_decision` flags.
2. **Gate firing condition (mechanical):** fire an `AskUserQuestion` **only if** the manifest has ≥1 surface with `requires_decision: true` AND no argument already pre-answers it (`gate=`, `skip_runtime`, or an explicit surface selection). Otherwise (pure-local test runners only / review-only / arg-answered) print a one-line plan and proceed **zero-click**.
3. When firing, confirm in ONE question: **gate scope** (review / runtime / both), **runtime scope** (which `requires_decision` surfaces to opt into — test runners are automatic), and **block policy** (`stop` / `skip` / `ask`). Record the opted-in surfaces as `approved_surfaces` and the chosen `block_policy`.

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Runtime scope: these surfaces can start processes or reach outside (requires_decision): <list>. Which should I run, and what should I do if one stays blocked after setup retries?",
      header: "Runtime scope",
      options: [
        {label: "Run all + skip blocked", description: "Opt into all listed surfaces; block_policy=skip (SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE, continue)."},
        {label: "Run all + ask on block", description: "Opt into all; block_policy=ask (mid-run question, bounded by DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS)."},
        {label: "Test runners only",       description: "Skip every requires_decision surface; run only automatic test runners."},
        {label: "Stop on block",            description: "Opt into all; block_policy=stop (abort the gate at the first unrecoverable block)."}
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

**Upfront approval is authoritative.** A surface opted in here is NOT re-asked mid-run. A mid-run question fires only for a *newly discovered* block when `block_policy=ask`, and the total number of such mid-run questions is itself bounded by `DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS`.

**Cost heads-up (AC13):** if the plan includes a web process-start surface (a heavy interactive flow on the inherited model), print one line before dispatching: `> Runtime gate will boot a web app and drive browser flows (heavier; inherited model).`

## Dispatch Loop

Full pipeline mode:

1. Run [Trivia escape](#trivia-escape). If trivia detected, print "Trivia diff — all gates skipped" and return.
2. Run [Upfront Execution Plan](#upfront-execution-plan) to fix gate scope, runtime scope (`approved_surfaces`), and `block_policy`. Zero-click unless a `requires_decision` surface exists and is not arg-answered.
3. Run [Review gate](#review-gate) (unless gate scope excludes it). Iterate up to 5 times; at each iteration end: findings empty → continue; non-empty → [Review iter boundary decision](#review-iter-boundary-decision).
4. If `skip_runtime` or gate scope excludes runtime, skip the Runtime gate and emit final summary.
5. Otherwise run [Runtime gate](#runtime-gate) (R0–R6).
6. Emit final summary.

## Trivia escape

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-trivia.sh`. Exit code:
- 0 = trivia detected → skip all gates. Print:
  > `Trivia diff — all gates skipped (one-sentence diff per CLAUDE.md trivia escape).`
- 1 = non-trivia → proceed to the Review gate.
- any other non-zero (script crash / environment failure) → print stderr
  verbatim and abort the pipeline. Do NOT silently treat as non-trivia.

## Review gate

Iterative fix-loop, `max_review_iterations = 5` (hard-coded constant).

For each iteration N (1..5):

1. Compute diff scope (paths / branch / session — from preflight result).
2. Dispatch the scout: `Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/scout.py ...)`.
3. Dispatch reviewer subagents in parallel (per [Reviewer dispatch contract](#reviewer-dispatch-contract)).
   `quality-gates:security-reviewer` and `quality-gates:adversarial` are
   the in-house dispatches that MUST include `project_dir: "$project_dir"`:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "quality-gates:security-reviewer",
  description: "Security review (Review gate iter N)",
  prompt: "Run code-level security review on the current diff.
    project_dir: \"$project_dir\"
    diff_scope: <paths|branch|session as resolved at preflight>
    plan_path: <path or 'auto'>
    iteration: N
    <…scout-supplied context…>"
})

Agent({
  subagent_type: "quality-gates:adversarial",
  description: "Adversarial review of Phase-1 findings (Review gate iter N)",
  prompt: "Re-review findings from Phase-1 reviewers for false positives
    and missed exploit paths.
    project_dir: \"$project_dir\"
    phase1_findings: <yaml from security-reviewer + code-reviewer + codex>
    iteration: N"
})
```

   `pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` (if pr-review-toolkit available) and
   the codex reviewer (if `detect_codex.sh` returns true) are dispatched
   with their own contracts; they do not require `project_dir` because
   they re-derive scope from the inlined diff blob.
   The codex reviewer additionally injects the project spec's Acceptance
   Criteria into its `<spec_context>` slot — resolved **script-internally** by
   `run_codex_reviewer.sh` (via `discover-spec.sh`), so no `spec_path` dispatch
   field and no `allowed-tools` change are needed here (invocation parity with
   the existing `discover-plan.sh` mechanism). `DEVBREW_QG_DISABLE_SPEC_CONFORMANCE=1`
   empties the slot — `run_codex_reviewer.sh` reads the env variable directly, so the orchestrator passes no additional argument for the codex path.
4. Dispatch `quality-gates:synthesizer` (or local synthesize_findings.py)
   to consolidate findings.
5. Compute boundary outcome:
   - findings empty → print `## Review gate iter N: clean` and exit the loop (continue to the Runtime gate).
   - findings non-empty → invoke [Review iter boundary decision](#review-iter-boundary-decision).

If iteration N=5 ends with findings still non-empty: invoke
[Review max-iter decision](#review-max-iter-decision) instead of the
normal iter-boundary decision.

---

The two decision templates below are tool-call literals; they fire only
on the non-empty-findings branch (iter-boundary) and on the iteration-5
exhaustion branch (max-iter). Each emits a single decision-tool invocation
with a unique header so the user can disambiguate iterations in the
transcript.

The iter-boundary anchor phrase `findings remain` is specific to this
template and must not appear in any other decision-tool call in this
SKILL, per spec AC6.

## Review iter boundary decision

> **Spec anchor (AC6):** the literal phrase `findings remain` MUST appear
> in the prompt — V2b grep checks this. This phrase is Review-iter-specific
> (not used in any other decision-tool call in this SKILL).

Call AskUserQuestion (replace `N` with the iteration number, `<summary>`
with the synthesizer's one-line summary):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Review gate iter N: findings remain (<summary>). What next?",
      header: "Review iter N",
      options: [
        {label: "Retry",              description: "Apply the suggested fixes (I will Edit the files in this turn), then re-run Review gate reviewers."},
        {label: "Proceed to Runtime gate",  description: "Accept current findings as-is and continue to runtime verification."},
        {label: "Stop",               description: "Abort the pipeline at this iteration. Address findings and re-run /qg."}
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

Branch on answer:
- **Retry** → apply user-consented fixes by calling Edit/Write directly
  with the synthesizer's suggested patches; increment iteration counter;
  loop back to step 1 of the Review gate section. See
  [Retry: file-write safety](#retry-file-write-safety) for the
  canonicalization requirement on reviewer-supplied paths, and
  [Retry: error handling](#retry-error-handling) for the AskUserQuestion
  surface that fires on Edit failures.
- **Proceed to Runtime gate** → exit the loop, continue to the Runtime gate with current
  findings recorded in History.
- **Stop** → emit final summary marked aborted at the Review gate.

### Retry: file-write safety

Before applying any reviewer-supplied `file:` field, canonicalize BOTH the
project root and the candidate path (symlink-traversal mitigation, I10):

```python
import os
root = os.path.realpath(project_dir)
candidate = os.path.realpath(supplied_file)
if os.path.commonpath([root, candidate]) != root:
    raise SecurityError(f"Path escapes project_dir: {candidate}")
```

Display the **full canonicalized file list** in the AskUserQuestion
`description` field (not just a `<summary>` field) so the user sees every
path that will be written. Reject and warn on any path resolving outside
`project_dir`.

### Retry: error handling

If `Edit` returns one of `old_string not unique`, `EACCES`, `ENOSPC`, or
any other failure during Retry application, do NOT silently skip.
Surface "Retry failed" via AskUserQuestion (abort retry or skip this file, never silent):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Retry failed at <file>: <reason>. Abort the retry iteration, or skip this file and continue with the remaining patches?",
      header: "Retry",
      options: [
        {label: "Abort retry",     description: "Abort this Retry iteration entirely; surface as failure to the Review gate verdict."},
        {label: "Skip this file",  description: "Skip THIS file's fix only; continue applying remaining Retry patches in this iteration."}
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

No silent retry-skip — every Edit failure surfaces a user choice. Labels
are explicit: "Abort retry" terminates the iteration; "Skip this file"
continues with remaining patches.

## Reviewer dispatch contract

The following four reviewer subagents declare `project_dir` as a REQUIRED
dispatch parameter and forbid `pwd`/`git rev-parse` recomputation inside
the persona. Any dispatch of these agents MUST thread the preflight-frozen
`$project_dir` value via the `project_dir:` field of the prompt:

- `quality-gates:adversarial`
- `quality-gates:test-scope-validator`
- `quality-gates:security-reviewer`
- `quality-gates:runtime-verifier`

The contract is verified by:
- runtime: agent personas reject prompts missing `project_dir:` (see
  `plugins/quality-gates/agents/*.md` frontmatter)
- static: `tests/harness/test_skill_orchestration_behavior.sh` asserts
  every `subagent_type: "<agent>"` block in this SKILL has a
  `project_dir:` line within 10 lines (AC1, AC6 protocol-shape)

## Review max-iter decision

After iteration 5 still has findings, do NOT silently halt. Call:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Review gate reached max 5 iterations. Last findings: <summary>. Proceed to the Runtime gate or stop?",
      header: "Review max-iter",
      options: [
        {label: "Proceed to Runtime gate", description: "Accept residual findings and continue."},
        {label: "Stop",              description: "Abort the pipeline. Address findings and re-run /qg."}
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

Branch on answer accordingly. (P18 unbounded-autonomy is satisfied by
this user-consent termination.)

## Runtime gate

If `skip_runtime` was set, skip this entire section.

**Step R0 — Create the sandbox (or fall back).** Seal the code-under-review into a disposable git-worktree:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/qg-worktree.sh" create-sandbox "<session-id>"
```

- Exit 0 → capture **line 1 = `sandbox_dir`**, **line 2 = `baseline_sha`**. The verifier's `project_dir` for this gate is `sandbox_dir` (frozen — overrides the preflight `project_dir` for the Runtime gate only).
- **Exit 3** (kill switch `DEVBREW_QG_DISABLE_RUNTIME_SANDBOX=1`) → graceful fallback: dispatch the verifier in **read-only smoke mode** against the real `project_dir`, and print the loud line: `> [quality-gates] runtime sandbox disabled — read-only smoke verification only (DEVBREW_QG_DISABLE_RUNTIME_SANDBOX=1).` Skip the mutation guard (Step R4) in this mode.
- Any other non-zero → surface stderr verbatim and mark the Runtime gate failed.

**Step R1 — test-scope-validator** (read-only reviewer; `project_dir` is the *preflight* dir, not the sandbox — it reviews the real diff). Per [Reviewer dispatch contract](#reviewer-dispatch-contract):

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "quality-gates:test-scope-validator",
  description: "Classify scope-relevant test files (Runtime gate)",
  prompt: "Validate test scope against current diff, spec acceptance criteria, and plan items.
    project_dir: \"$project_dir\"
    spec_path: <path or 'auto'; pass 'none' if DEVBREW_QG_DISABLE_SPEC_CONFORMANCE=1>
    plan_path: <path or 'auto'>
    candidate_test_files: <list from scope-detection step>"
})
```

**Step R2 — gather spec Acceptance Criteria.** Resolve the spec (reuse `discover-spec.sh` semantics already used by test-scope-validator) and build `spec_acceptance_criteria` as a `{ac_id, text}` list. If no spec, pass an empty list (the verifier falls back to plan_features → smoke).

**Step R3 — dispatch runtime-verifier (executor)** with `project_dir = sandbox_dir`, the spec AC, the approved surfaces, and the block policy:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "quality-gates:runtime-verifier",
  description: "Runtime verification (Runtime gate, sandbox executor)",
  prompt: "Boot the declared surfaces in the sandbox, drive flows, assert against spec AC, write an evidence-log.
    project_dir: \"$sandbox_dir\"
    spec_acceptance_criteria: <{ac_id,text} list or []>
    manifest: <output of detect-runtime.sh>
    approved_surfaces: <surfaces opted in at the Upfront Execution Plan>
    block_policy: <stop|skip|ask>
    resolution_iter: <N (1..DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS)>"
})
```

**Step R4 — Mutation guard (authoritative verdict cap).** Unless in read-only fallback, compute the product-mutation oracle:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/qg-worktree.sh" mutation-guard "<sandbox_dir>" "<baseline_sha>"
```

Read the YAML. **If `forced_downgrade: yes`**, the verdict is capped at FAIL regardless of the verifier's emitted verdict (Law 2 — the verifier cannot self-approve a product change). Surface `tracked_diff` + `disallowed_new_files` as evidence ("the app only ran after this change — fix it in a normal writer→review cycle"). The verifier's own `writes:` self-report is advisory only; this git result is authoritative.

**Step R5 — Discard the sandbox** (verdict-independent), unless in read-only fallback:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/qg-worktree.sh" remove "<sandbox_dir>"
```

**Step R6 — Outcome routing** (verdict = min(verifier verdict, guard cap)):

- **Clean (PASS) AND `forced_downgrade: no`** → print `## Runtime gate — clean` and continue to final summary.
- **`forced_downgrade: yes`** → print the Runtime gate FAIL block including the surfaced diff; emit final summary marked Runtime gate failure. Do NOT auto-restart, do NOT apply the diff (in-gate accept is out of scope).
- **FAIL** (product bug / unrecoverable) → print verdict block; final summary marked failure.
- **SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE** → print evidence; continue.
- **NEEDS_RESOLUTION** → invoke [Runtime NEEDS_RESOLUTION decision](#runtime-needs_resolution-decision).

## Blocked-path routing

A surface is *blocked* when the executor cannot complete it. Routing (per-surface — one block never aborts the others):

| Block kind | Handling |
|---|---|
| setup-fixable (.env/deps) | executor auto-fixes in sandbox + retries (≤3/dispatch). Success → continue; exhausted → `NEEDS_RESOLUTION`. |
| operational-safety (prod config/network needed) | NOT run. Recorded `blocked-for-safety` → SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE or NEEDS_RESOLUTION("provide test config"). |
| needs-decision (`requires_decision` not in `approved_surfaces`) | NOT run → SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE. |
| product bug (AC unmet / won't boot from product defect) | FAIL + evidence. Not a retry. |
| hang/timeout | per-surface wall-clock kill; record blocked; continue with remaining surfaces. |

On executor `NEEDS_RESOLUTION` (setup retries exhausted), apply the upfront `block_policy`:
- `stop` → abort the gate at the block; terminal summary.
- `skip` → record SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE for that surface; finalize with partial results.
- `ask` → invoke [Runtime NEEDS_RESOLUTION decision](#runtime-needs_resolution-decision) (retry / skip-with-evidence / stop). Total `ask` mid-run questions are bounded by `DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS`; on exhaustion, fall through to skip-with-evidence.

---

The NEEDS_RESOLUTION branch is the only Runtime gate outcome that surfaces a user question when `block_policy=ask`. It is bounded by `DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS` so a mis-configured environment cannot loop indefinitely.

Per spec AC8 and the secret-policy rule (P21), the prompt body asks the user to place secrets on disk first and respond yes/no. Never request a secret value as a literal string.

## Runtime NEEDS_RESOLUTION decision

> **Spec anchor (AC8):** the literal phrase `Runtime verifier needs` MUST appear in the prompt — V2b grep checks this. **P21 reaffirmation MUST also appear in the prompt body** (literal token `P21`) — the prompt never asks for secret values, only paths or yes/no.

Loop up to `DEVBREW_QG_RUNTIME_MAX_RESOLUTIONS` times (default 3, env override clamped 0..10):

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Runtime verifier needs: <missing resource description>. (P21: never paste secrets into this prompt — add them to .env / config on disk first, then choose Yes, retry.)",
      header: "Runtime resolve",
      options: [
        {label: "Yes, retry",         description: "I've added the missing resource on disk. Re-run the Runtime gate."},
        {label: "Skip with evidence", description: "Mark the Runtime gate SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE with reason."},
        {label: "Stop",               description: "Abort the pipeline at the Runtime gate."}
      ],
      multiSelect: false
    }
  ]
})
```

Branch:
- **Yes, retry** → increment resolution counter; if exceeds env limit, fall through to Skip with evidence. Otherwise re-create the sandbox (Step R0) so retries start from a clean baseline, then re-dispatch runtime-verifier.
- **Skip with evidence** → record SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE and continue.
- **Stop** → final summary aborted at the Runtime gate.

## Final Summary

Print:

```markdown
## Quality Gates Pipeline — Complete (v2.2.0)

- **Review gate**: <clean iter N | proceeded-with-findings iter N | aborted iter N | skipped>
- **Runtime gate**: <clean | failed | SKIP_WITH_EVIDENCE | aborted | skipped>

**History:**
<copy the appended ## History lines from the state file>
```

State file cleanup is deferred to /cancel-qg or SessionEnd cleanup hook.

## Rules

**R1 (Law 2 — physical):** never call Edit/Write on agent persona files
(`plugins/quality-gates/agents/*.md`) in this turn. The orchestrator may
edit working-tree files for user-consented Review gate fixes only.

**R2 (state file write invariant):** never write `pipeline.md` frontmatter.
You MAY append a single line to the `## History` section per gate verdict;
do not modify any other content. Frontmatter is owned by setup-qg.sh.

**R3 (no fake user messages):** v1.32.0 has no Stop hook continuation, no
emission tag, and no continuation sentinel. Do NOT emit any such marker.

**R4 (P21 secret policy):** the decision-tool prompts never request a
secret value as a string. For Runtime gate missing-credential resolution, ask
the user to place secrets on disk (`.env`, config file) and respond yes/no.

**R5 (single dispatch per turn):** the entire pipeline runs in one turn.
Do not call setup-qg.sh more than once. Do not call check-trivia.sh more
